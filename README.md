What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW), and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models, and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera-based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).

How to Install
------

Easiest way to install FrogPilot is via this URL at the installation screen:

```
frogpilot.download
```

DO NOT install the "FrogPilot-Development" branch. I'm constantly breaking things on there, so unless you don't want to use openpilot, NEVER install it!
