openpilot in simulator
=====================

openpilot implements a [bridge](run_bridge.py) that allows it to run in the [MetaDrive simulator](https://github.com/metadriverse/metadrive).

## Launching openpilot
First, start openpilot. Note that you will either need a [mapbox token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/#how-access-tokens-work) (set with ```export MAPBOX_TOKEN="1234"```), or to disable mapsd with ```export BLOCK=mapsd```
``` bash
# Run locally
./tools/sim/launch_openpilot.sh
```

## Bridge usage
```
$ ./run_bridge.py -h
usage: run_bridge.py [-h] [--joystick] [--high_quality] [--dual_camera]
Bridge between the simulator and openpilot.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --joystick
  --high_quality
  --dual_camera
```

#### Bridge Controls:
- To engage openpilot press 2, then press 1 to increase the speed and 2 to decrease.
- To disengage, press "S" (simulates a user brake)

#### All inputs:

```
